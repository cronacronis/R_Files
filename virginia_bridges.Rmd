# Introduction

![35WBridgeCollapseImage1](/Users/stuart/DataSets/virginia/4110758.jpg)

Quoting from a recent [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/time-fix-americas-infrastructure-heres-start/) article:
  
In the United States, one in 10 bridges are structurally deficient, meaning the bridge has a significant defect that requires reduced loads, reduced speed limits, or rehabilitation. Another 14 percent of the nation’s 607,380 bridges are considered “functionally obsolete,” meaning they are no longer suited to their current task -- yet are still in use.

As recently as January 2015, an overpass collapsed on I-75 in Cincinnati as it was being dismantled, killing a construction worker and gravely injuring a truck driver. It remains to be seen if the collapse was due to the age and condition of the span, or was an unfortunate demolition accident, but it underscores the risks. More well known was the collapse of the I-35 West Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis seven years ago. Thirteen people were killed and 145 injured. The bridge had been deemed structurally deficient in 1990, though the collapse was attributed to a design flaw that was exacerbated by an increase in bridge load over time.

The American Society of Civil Engineers says the US needs massive investments in all essential infrastructure, from bridges and airports to dams and railways. According to the society’s most recent infrastructure report card, the US earns a D+ for its infrastructure. It is, in a word, a mess. This is about much more than potholes. This is about keeping the economy, literally and figuratively, moving. Much of the economic boom the United States has experienced over the last 50 years is because the network of highways makes it easy to ship goods. If it continues into a state of disrepair, the long-term hit to our economy could be catastrophic.

#### Study Goal
This analysis focuses on the state of Virginia's bridge infrastructure. Virginia (particularly Northern VA) is experiencing population growth, fueled by a strong local economy, yet, it has a commensurate aging infrastructure. How sound is Virginia's existing bridge infrastructure? How many bridges are in need of repair? Are highly traveled bridges sound? How much will fixing the infrastructure cost? A goal of this analysis is to statistically describe the state of Virginia's bridge infrastructure so that an objective assessment regarding the magnitude of safety issues and budget impacts can support a decision making process. 

# Data Set
The data set used for this analysis was obtained from [Open Virginia](http://data.openva.com/dataset/bridge-inspections). The data was current as of January 2014. It consists of 21,232 observations (i.e., bridges). Below is a listing of the original data (prior to any modifications) explicitly identifying variables and their data type:

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,results='markup'}
glimpse(bridges)
```

Data analysis requires documenting any modifications made to a data set. Modifications often take the form of "cleaning" the data, in order to make the values compatible for statistical analysis and modeling. Though the modifications we made are documented in the code base, a few highlights are mentioned here:

1. Removal of variables:  Several sparsely populated variables were removed.  Keeping them would have resulted in an unbalanced data set. To identify the specific variables removed, one can refer to the code base associated with this analysis. 

2. Conversion of variable value types: All value types entered into the original data set were character values (e.g., year built and various metrics). These were converted to an appropriate numerical type.

3. Removal of observations (entries): Some variables, though not sparsely populated, either did not have an entry or contained a "nonsense" value (e.g., -1 for a sufficiency rating). The observations corresponding these entries were removed. For example, the "Year.Built" entry resulted in removing 472 observations (`r round(472/21232 * 100,1)` percent). This is a concern since in those removed bridge observations, there may be some that are potentially structurally deficient. Given the low percentage, we removed these observations. A solution would be to travel to those particular areas and research county records; however, due to lack of resources associated with this IRAD, and need for accuracy, we removed them. 

# Budget Planning

### Magnitude of Problem: Aging Bridge Infrastructure

<!--- Before doing analysis, transform the bridges df -->

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bridges$Single.Sign...Single.Unit.Vehicle...Posted.Capacity..in.tons.= NULL
bridges$Dual.Sign...Single.Unit.Vehicle...Posted.Capacity..in.tons. = NULL
bridges$Dual.Sign...Combination.Unit.Vehicle...Posted.Capacity..in.tons. = NULL
bridges$Weight.Posting.Status=NULL
bridges$Responsibility=NULL
bridges$Func.Obslt=NULL
bridges$Struc.Defic=NULL
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
# Need to convert several chr fields to numeric:
bridges$Year.Built.Numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(bridges$Year.Built))
bridges$Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(bridges$Avg.Daily.Traffic))
bridges$Health.Index.Numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(bridges$Health.Index))
bridges$Suffic.Rating.Numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(bridges$Suffic.Rating))

bridges_numeric_built_df <- subset(bridges,bridges$Year.Built.Numeric != "  NA" & bridges$Year.Built.Numeric > 1800)
obs_removed <- nrow(bridges) - nrow(bridges_numeric_built_df); obs_removed
bridges <- bridges_numeric_built_df
```


Virginia has some of the oldest bridges in the United States, where the oldest bridge contained in our final data set was built in `r min(bridges$Year.Built.Numeric)`.  The mean bridge construction year is `r round(mean(bridges$Year.Built.Numeric),0)`. A plot which describes the distribution of when Virginia bridges were built is provided below. 


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bridges, aes(x=Year.Built.Numeric)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5, fill="red", colour="black") +
  labs(x="Year Bridge Built (binwidth = 5 years)", y="Bridge Count", title = "Yearly Distribution of Virginia Bridge Building")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bigbuildyear <- bridges %>%
  group_by(Year.Built.Numeric) %>%
  summarise(bridges.built = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(bridges.built))
```

From this distribution, we see three distinct modes, with the most significant one occuring around 1930. Accounting for the distribution's bin-width spanning 5 years, analysis of the data shows that in the year  `r bigbuildyear$Year.Built.Numeric[1]` a total of `r bigbuildyear$bridges.built[1]` bridges were built. One possible explanation of this tremendous spike may be attributed to U.S. President Herbert Hoover, who during his first two years as President increased Federal expenditures for public work projects - particularly road related projects. Immediately following these two years of funding, the Revenue Act of 1932 was enacted, drastically reducing Federal expenditures. This may explain the sharp peak followed by a dramatic reduction in bridge building. The more salient point is that these bridges were built 83 years ago. 

We now look at some basic descriptive statistics related to Virginia bridge building and the aging bridge infrastructure.


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(bridges$Year.Built.Numeric)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
boxplot(bridges$Year.Built.Numeric,
        pars=list(boxwex = 0.4),
        ylab = "Year",
        main = "Box-Plot of Bridges Built by Year")
rug(jitter(bridges$Year.Built.Numeric, amount = 0.2),side=2,col="red")
```

From the box plot and summary above, we see that 25% of the bridges (`r 0.25 * nrow(bridges)` bridges) were built prior to 1948 (greater than or equal to 67 years old). We see several outliers (beyond 1.5 * IQR), in fact, there exist `r nrow(subset(bridges, Year.Built.Numeric <= 1900))` bridges built prior to or within the year 1900. 50% of bridges (`r 0.25 * nrow(bridges)` bridges) were built prior to 1968 (47 years old or greater). The median and mean are nearly equivalent. 
This distribution begins to highlight the potentially obsolete and dangerous state of Virginia's bridges. However, it's only scratching the surface. Within the data set, are data that contains the dates of Federal and State bridge reconstruction efforts per bridge. So, a bridge may have a construction date of 1927, but may have experience bridge reconstruction efforts to fix any defects and make it suitable for increased traffic volume and loads. So how can we get a good overall metric describing overall bridge health - and is it available within the available data set?

# Safety

### Bridge Inspections and Ratings Background

On August 1, 2007, the I-35W highway bridge in Minnesota collapsed, where 111 vehicles were on the bridge at the time, 11 people died, and 145 people were injured. Following this collapse, a national discussion focused on bridges being classified as structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. Of course, these discussions have led to confusion as to the actual meaning and definitions. This led to defining a bridge's "Sufficiency Rating."

NOTE: According to the [Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)](http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/bridge_defs.pdf), VDOT exceeds the Federally established National Bridge Inspection (NBI) standards by inspecting and documenting all bridges regardless of their length and all culverts having an opening greater than 36 square feet. (NOTE: Most of the narrative text is lifted from the above website)

#### Bridge Sufficiency Rating

What is a bridge’s “Sufficiency Rating?” Sufficiency ratings were developed by the Federal Highway Administration to serve as a prioritization tool to allocate funds. The rating varies from 0 percent (poor) to 100 percent (very good). The formula considers structural adequacy, whether the bridge is functionally obsolete and level of service provided to the public. 

The sufficiency rating formula is a method of evaluating a bridge’s sufficiency to remain in service, based on a combination of several factors. The result of the formula is a percentage in which 100 percent represents an entirely sufficient bridge and zero percent represents an entirely insufficient or deficient bridge. Though the sufficiency rating doesn’t necessarily indicate a bridge’s ability to carry traffic loads, it helps determine which bridges may need repair or replacement. 

A bridge’s sufficiency rating also affects its eligibility for federal funding for maintenance, rehabilitation, or replacement. For bridges to qualify for federal replacement funds, they must have a rating of 50 or below. To qualify for federal rehabilitation funding, a bridge must have a sufficiency rating of 80 or below.

### Bridge Counts versus Sufficiency Ratings

Fortunately, our data set containes sufficiency ratings. It should be noted that we removed `r nrow(subset(bridges,Suffic.Rating.Numeric < 0))` bridges from the data set prior to performing any analysis. Because the Sufficiency Ratings have a range in values from 0 to 100, bridges having Sufficiency Ratings not within that range were removed. The bridges removed had Sufficiency Ratings less than 0. Let's take a look at Virginia's bridge sufficiency ratings.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE}
bridges_srnot0 <- subset(bridges,Suffic.Rating.Numeric >= 0)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(bridges_srnot0$Suffic.Rating.Numeric)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
boxplot(bridges_srnot0$Suffic.Rating.Numeric,
        pars=list(boxwex = 0.4),
        ylab = "Sufficiency Rating",
        main = "Virginia Bridges Sufficiency Ratings")
rug(jitter(bridges_srnot0$Suffic.Rating.Numeric, amount = 0.2),side=2,col="red")
```

From the above statistical summary and box-plot of Sufficiency Ratings. 

1. Median of `r median(bridges_srnot0$Suffic.Rating.Numeric)` and Mean of `r round(mean(bridges_srnot0$Suffic.Rating.Numeric,2))`: This means that approximately 50% of the bridges have a good sufficiency rating. 

2. The lower quartile, 25% of Virginia bridges (`r nrow(subset(bridges_srnot0, Suffic.Rating.Numeric <= 72.7))` bridges) have a rating of 72.7 or below. This means that these bridges are eligible for Federal rehabiitation funding. 

We now plot the distribution of bridges per Sufficiency. Vertical lines are drawn at Sufficiency Ratings of 50 and 80. This helps illustrate the number of bridges eligible for rehavilitation or replacement funds. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bridges_srnot0, aes(x=Suffic.Rating.Numeric)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=2, fill="red", colour="black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(50,80), linetype="dashed",colour="black") +
  labs(x="Sufficiency Rating", y="Bridge Count", title = "Distribution of Virginia Bridge Sufficiency Ratings")
```

The above plot, illustrates the magnitude of the problem:

1. The total amount of Virginia bridges available for federal rehabilitation funding, counting those bridges with a sufficiency rating of 80 or below is: `r nrow(subset(bridges_srnot0, Suffic.Rating.Numeric <= 80))` bridges, or `r round(nrow(subset(bridges_srnot0,Suffic.Rating.Numeric <= 80))/nrow(bridges_srnot0) * 100,2)` percent of Virginia's bridges. 

2. The total amount of Virginia bridges available for federal replacment funding, counting those bridges with a sufficiency rating of 50 or below is: `r nrow(subset(bridges_srnot0, Suffic.Rating.Numeric <= 50))` bridges, or `r round(nrow(subset(bridges_srnot0, Suffic.Rating.Numeric <= 50))/nrow(bridges_srnot0) * 100,2)` percent of Virginia's bridges.

Finally, we plot the bridges sufficiency rating versus the year the bridge was constructed.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bridges_redux <- subset(bridges_srnot0, select = c(Year.Built.Numeric, Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric, Suffic.Rating.Numeric) )
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bridges_redux, aes(x=Year.Built.Numeric, y=Suffic.Rating.Numeric)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(50,80), linetype="dashed", colour="red") + 
  labs(x="Year Built", y="Sufficiency Rating", title = "Sufficiency Rating versus Year Bridge Built")
```

The above chart is surprising because one would expect "newly" constructed bridges to have sufficiency ratings not eligible to receive replacement or rehabilitation funds. Clearly, this is not the case in Virginia. There are in fact (assuming the data set is correct) numerous bridges built after the year 2000 with sufficiency ratings less than 80 and 50. Our of curiosity, we list below, those jurisdictions with bridges constructed after the year 2000 and have sufficiency ratings less than 80. Because there are 74 jurisdictions meeting this criteria, we only list those with 8 or more bridges meeting this criteria.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='markup'}
more_bad_bridges <- subset(bridges, Year.Built.Numeric > 2000 & Suffic.Rating.Numeric < 80)
more_bad_bridges %>%
  group_by(Jurisdiction) %>%
  summarise(Bad_Bridges = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Bad_Bridges)) %>%
  filter(Bad_Bridges > 4)
```

What does this mean? Perhaps the contractors took "shortcuts" when constructing the bridges. Perhaps a bad specification was provided. Perhaps a recent storm impacted the bridge's integrity. Further investigation is required. 

# Recommendations

Up to this point, we have been statistically describing the state of Virginia's bridges, primarily using the Sufficiency Rating metric. As described, Virginia has many bridges that are eligible for refurbishment and replacement. Given the finite resources (primarily budgets) available, how would Virginia prioritize this work?

### Which Bridges to Fix?

There are numerous ways to prioritize which bridges get restored or replaced. One way would be to prioritize based on lowest sufficiency ratings (i.e., fix the bridges that are in the worse condition). But what if a bridge that has a median-level sufficiency rating supports a high daily traffic volume in an area with a trending increasing annual population. This bridge's sufficiency rating would likely decline more rapidly and would have a much larger economic and human fatality/injury impact than a really "bad" bridge serving a rural population with a low traffic volume - purely looking at the numbers. 

As a first approximation to prioritize the restoration and replacement of bridges, we'll focus on those counties with larger populations, population growth, and significant commuters with low bridge sufficiency ratings. 

#### Population Centers and Growth

Which Virginia counties have the largest populations and have a trending growing population? 

Below is a figure that plots each Virginia county's population from 1970 to 2012. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(virginia.pop, aes(x=periodyear, y=population, colour=areaname,group=areaname)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  ggtitle("Annual Virginia County Population Growth Curves")
```

From the above figure, most of Virginia's 95 counties have relatively low, and stable population levels. But, there five counties with growing populations that in 2010, exceeded 300,000. They are:

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
growers <- virginia.pop %>%
  filter(population > 300000) %>%
  select(areaname, periodyear, population) %>%
  filter(periodyear == 2010) %>%
  arrange(desc(population)); growers
```

Following our logic, how many bridges exist in these counties have a sufficiency rating less than 50 (justifying replacement)? From the table below, we see there are over 100 bridges in this category.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
top.five <- bridges %>%
  filter(Jurisdiction == 'Fairfax County' | Jurisdiction == 'Prince William County' | Jurisdiction == 'Chesterfield County' | Jurisdiction == 'Loudoun County' | Jurisdiction == 'Henrico County') %>%
  filter(Suffic.Rating.Numeric < 50) %>%
  group_by(Jurisdiction) %>%
  summarise(Bridges.SuffRating.lt.50 = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Bridges.SuffRating.lt.50)); top.five
```

#### Bridge Average Daily Traffic Volume

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(bridges, aes(x=Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, fill="red", colour="black") +
  labs(x="Average Daily Bridge Traffic (binwidth = 50)", y="Bridge Count", title = "Distribution of Virginia Bridge Average Daily Traffic")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
boxplot(bridges$Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric,
        pars=list(boxwex = 0.4),
        ylab = "Average Daily Traffic",
        main = "Box-Plot of Bridges Average Daily Traffic")
rug(jitter(bridges$Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric, amount = 0.2),side=2,col="red")
```

#### Vehicle Traffic versus Sufficiency Rating - Playing the Odds?

A quick correlation/variance analysis highlighted an interesting relationship between a bridge's average daily traffic pattern and its' sufficiency rating. This relationship (using a Pearson correlation) was calculated to be slightly negative (see below). One could rationalize that due to "wear and tear" of a higher traffic volume, bridges would be expected to have  a lower sufficiency rating. Or, a higher traffic average traffic volume would lead to a bridge's sufficiency rating decreasing at a faster rate than one experiencing a lower traffic volume. We leave this as a potential future modeling exercise. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bridges_redux <- subset(bridges_srnot0, select = c(Year.Built.Numeric, Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric, Suffic.Rating.Numeric) )
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='markdown'}
cor(bridges_redux, use="complete.obs")
```

We now make a scatter plot of the average daily traffic of the bridge count versus the sufficiency rating, wehre we again place vertical dashed lines at sufficiency ratings of 50 and 80. We also provide a horizontal dashed line correspoding the mean average daily traffic of `r round(mean(bridges_srnot0$Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric),2)` cars. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
meantraffic <- mean(bridges_redux$Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric)
ggplot(bridges_redux, aes(x=Suffic.Rating.Numeric, y=Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=meantraffic, linetype="dashed",colour="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(50,80), linetype="dashed",colour="red") +
  labs(x="Bridge Sufficiency Rating", y="Average Daily Traffic", title = "Daily Traffic vs Bridge Sufficiency")
```

The above scatter plot clearly shows a significant number of bridges experiencing some of the highest average daily traffic that are eligible for rehabilitation funding. Where are these bridges located? Let's identify the bridge locations (by Jurisdiction) with an average daily traffic volume exceeding 100,000 vehicles per day (well above the mean traffic volume) and a sufficiency rating less than 80.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bad_bridges <- subset(bridges, Avg.Daily.Traffic.Numeric > 100000 & Suffic.Rating.Numeric < 80)
bad_bridges %>%
  group_by(Jurisdiction) %>%
  summarise(Bad_Bridges = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Bad_Bridges))
```
